# Recipes Website

I will be creating a recipe list, this will be most basic as it is my first test with The Odin Project. 
I will also be testing my knowledge on the following below

* Anchoring
* basic HTML formatting
* Adding Images to my webpage
* Making sure that I have a src and alt
* Making sure to have a good time!

* I forgot to include my strong <strong>text</strong> and my em <em>text</em>!
